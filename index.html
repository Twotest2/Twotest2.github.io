                    C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,
                    and used to re-implement the Unix operating system.

                    It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,
                    with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer
                    architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the American National
                    Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International
                     Organization for Standardization (ISO).

                <p>
                     C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a
                     relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide
                     language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal
                      run-time support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to
                      encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C
                      program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating
                      systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a
                      very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

                    The development of C started in 1972 on the PDP-11 Unix system and first appeared in Version
                    2 Unix. The language was not initially designed with portability in mind, but soon ran on
                    different platforms as well: a compiler for the Honeywell 6000 was written within the
                    first year of C's history, while an IBM System/370 port followed soon. 							Also in 1972, a large part of Unix was rewritten in C. By 1973, with the addition of struct types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the Unix kernelwas now in C.

                    C is widely used for system programming in implementing operating systems and embedded
                    system applications, because C code, when written for portability, can be used for most
                    purposes, yet when needed, system-specific code can be used to access specific hardware
                    addresses and to perform type punning to match externally imposed interface requirements,
                    with a low run-time demand on system resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C can also be used for website programming using CGI as a "gateway" for information
                    between the Web application, the server, and the browser. C is often chosen over
                    interpreted languages because of its speed, stability, and near-universal availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One consequence of C wide availability and efficiency is that compilers, libraries
                    and interpreters of other programming languages are often implemented in C. The reference
                    implementations of Python, Perl and PHP, for example, are all written in C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common C library is the C standard library, which is specified by the ISO and
                    ANSI C standards and comes with every C implementation (implementations which target
                    limited environments such as embedded systems may provide only a subset of the standard
                    library). This library supports stream input and output, memory allocation, mathematics,
                    character strings, and time values. Several separate standard headers (for example, stdio.h)
                    specify the interfaces for these and other standard library facilities.

                    In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with
                    Classes", the predecessor to C++.The motivation for creating a new language originated
                    from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. Stroustrup found
                    that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but
                    the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level
                    to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in
                    AT&amp;T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to
                    distributed computing.

                <p>
                    In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C),
                    adding new features that included virtual functions, function name and operator overloading,
                    references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type
                    checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore,
                    it included the development of a standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.

                    The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++
                    programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes vectors,
                    lists, maps, algorithms (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), sets, queues,
                    stacks, arrays, tuples, input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to
                    the console and files), smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression
                    support, multi-threading library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written
                    to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities
                    (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that
                    doesn't use C++ exceptions into C++ exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly
                    modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).

                    C++ is often considered to be a superset of C, but this is not strictly true. Most C
                    code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++, but there are a few differences
                    that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C
                    allows implicit conversion from void* to other pointer types, but C++ does not (for type
                    safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may
                    be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.

                    Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language,
                    but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly
                    announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed
                    C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.

                    Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on
                    increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming somewhat less similar. One of the first major

                    James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in
                    June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced
                    for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak
                    after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name
                    Greenand was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style
                    syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.

                    Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised
                    "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.
                    Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access
                    restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within
                    web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java
                    by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.

                    One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java
                    platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with
                    adequate runtime support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an
                    intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to
                    architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine
                    code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically
                    for the host hardware. End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed
                    on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java
                    applets.

                    versions currently officially supported), macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks
                    any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other
                    third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.
