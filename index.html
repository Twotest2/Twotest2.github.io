                    The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour,
                    though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated form
                    of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably
                    originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly
                    eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The
                    domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable,
                    less woody-textured taproot.
